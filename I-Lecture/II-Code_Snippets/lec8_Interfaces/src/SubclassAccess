Subclass Access

* Subclasses cannot access private fields in their superclasses
* Two options:
    - Leave as is; provide accessors and/or mutators
    - Change private to protected
        -- Protected allows subclass access to superclass fields (even if the subclass is in a different package)
*** General advice: use accessors and mutators
