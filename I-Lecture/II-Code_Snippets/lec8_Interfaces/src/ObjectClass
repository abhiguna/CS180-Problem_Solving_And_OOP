Object Class

- All methods in Java inherit the Object Class implicitly.

* Class can only "extend" one class but
        can "implement" multiple interfaces.

* Java = "Single Inheritance System".

Useful Methods in Object Class:
1. clone() - Makes a copy of the Object.
2. equals(Object e);
3. toString();
    - Can be Overriden.
