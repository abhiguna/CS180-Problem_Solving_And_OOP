Problem: DaisyDriveIn

- if you work more than 20 hours at the Daisy Drive-in,
they pay you $8/hour for first 20 hours plus $10/hour
for all hours above 20.  Otherwise, they pay you $7/hour

- Write a method: computePay()

double computePay(double hours) {
    boolean hoursGreaterThan20 = hours > 20;
    double wages = 0.0;
    if (hoursGreaterThan20) {
        int deltaWork = hours - 20;
        wages = (8.00 * 20) + (10.00 * deltaWork);
    }
    else {
        wages = 7.00 * hours;
    }
    return wages;
}
