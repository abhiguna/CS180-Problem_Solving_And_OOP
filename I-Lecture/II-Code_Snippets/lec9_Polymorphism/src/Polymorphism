Polymorphism

- Very Important OOP Concept.
- In essence, the superclass takes a reference to the subclass.
- However, the compiler executes the subclass implementation of overridden-methods.

- "superclass" references "subclass"

Why?
- Allows generic treatment between classes.
- Eg. GUI is a subclass of "Component"
