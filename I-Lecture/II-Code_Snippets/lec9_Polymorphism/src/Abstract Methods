Abstract Methods

Methods may be declared abstract
- Provide only the header (no body)
- Class must then be declared abstract
Methods in an interface are implicitly declared abstract
When subclassing an abstract class
- Generally provide method bodies for abstract methods
- If abstract methods remain, then subclass is still abstract and must be declared so
