* Multiple Try-Catch Blocks

try {
    --Statements-That-May-Throw-An-Exception--
} catch (StudentNotFoundException e) {
    // code to handle student not found.
} catch (NullPointerException e) {
    // code to handle NullPointerException.
} catch (Exception e) {
    // code to handle all other exceptions.
}

* Finally Clause

- The "finally" clause is executed after all other try/catch statements.
- the "finally" clause is guaranteed to execute.

try {
    ...statements-that-may-throw-exceptions;
} catch (StudentNotFoundException e) {
    // code to handle student not found
    ...
} finally {
    // code to clean things up.
}
