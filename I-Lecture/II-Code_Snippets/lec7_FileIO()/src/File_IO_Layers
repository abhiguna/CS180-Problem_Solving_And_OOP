Low-Level
- “Raw” data transfer: byte-oriented
- Classes: FileOutputStream, FileInputStream

High-Level
- Java primitive types
- Classes: DataOutputStream, DataInputStream

Object I/O
- Java object types
- Classes: ObjectOutputStream, ObjectInputStream

* Ultimately, all data stored as a sequence of bytes
