A Java thread goes through several states in its lifetime:
* New thread: created but not yet started
* Runnable: started and available to be run
* Not Runnable: sleeping, waiting for i/o, etc.

Terminated: returned from the run() method
* t.sleep(n) puts the current thread to sleep for n milliseconds; allows other threads to run
* t.yield() “gives up” the CPU, letting another thread run
